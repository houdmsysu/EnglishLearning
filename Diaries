20180926_The Worst Weather in Your Life
The worst weather I had came across is the rain and flood. That was when I was at the primary school. There was a flood after rainstorms 
and the road from school to my home was nearly flooded. I was upset that I couldn't go home after school. What's more, I dared not go across 
the bridge, under which the flood flew quite fast. My parents were making money in a city from my hometown, while my grandma took care of me.
I stepped on the bridge, trembling with fear. I tried to walk along the center line and tried to not see the flowing water for I would feel 
dizzy. After a while, I went accross the bridge successfully. I felt excited for I overcame a difficulty. When I came into my grandma who was 
on the way to pick me up from school, I talked with her about the experience proudly and got her praise.



He is being stupid. He pretends or looks stupid, but he is acctually not stupid.
He is just being polite.
They are always sending me a lot of trash messages.
He is always talking about you. / He is always calling me.
I thought he was a soldier. / I expected he could win.
