20180926_The Worst Weather in Your Life
The worst weather I had came across is the rain and flood. That was when I was at the primary school. There was a flood after rainstorms 
and the road from school to my home was nearly flooded. I was upset that I couldn't go home after school. What's more, I dared not go across 
the bridge, under which the flood flew quite fast. My parents were making money in a city from my hometown, while my grandma took care of me.
I stepped on the bridge, trembling with fear. I tried to walk along the center line and tried to not see the flowing water for I would feel 
dizzy. After a while, I went accross the bridge successfully. I felt excited for I overcame a difficulty. When I came into my grandma who was 
on the way to pick me up from school, I talked with her about the experience proudly and got her praise.

I thought he was a soldier. / I expected he could win.
