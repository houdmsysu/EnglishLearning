India:
India, short for Republic of India, is the biggest country in South Asia. It has frontiers Pakistan in the northwest, Burma in the east, 
and Sri Lanka in the southeast. Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China border on it in the northeast(Arabian sea, Bay of Bengal). It has vast 
territory and abundant resources.

As one of the four great ancient civilizations, India has a history of nearly 5000 years. It is the cradleland/birthplace of Buddhism which has a big 
influence to the world. During the reign of Emperor Tai Zong(627-649) of the Tang Dynasty, at his request, esteemed Buddhist Monk Xuan Zhang 
was sent to India for scriptures. Even in contemporary China, some customs derive their origin from Buddhism.

Different nation has different customs. So does India. Typical India people greet each other by saying "Namaste, Namaste, Namaste" which means 
"I bow to you".
